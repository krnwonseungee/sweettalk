my
one
and
only
love
my
princess
"angel,"
i
love
you
and
miss
you
and
am
thinking
about
you
non-stop.
you
are
always
in
my
heart
and
on
my
mind.
there
is
nothing
i
wouldn't
do
to
see
you
smile
and
hear
you
laugh
that
laugh
that
even
the
angels
in
heaven
would
envy.
you
are
the
light
and
the
warmth
in
my
"darkness,"
and
the
wholeness
in
my
life.
without
you
"here,"
i
sail
in
darkness
losing
my
way.
but
fortunately
you
are
"there,"
my
guiding
star
in
the
night
sky.
shining
"bright,"
clear
and
"strong,"
showing
me
the
way
with
a
love
that
stretches
from
heaven
to
the
ends
of
creation.
and
the
only
problem
i
have
is
that
there
aren't
any
words
good
enough
for
me
to
tell
you
how
i
truly
feel
about
"you,"
no
words
except
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
"soul,"
always
and
forever.
you
are
my
one
and
only
princess
"angel,"
and
my
only
love.

the
love
of
my
life
you're
my
best
friend
and
my
lover
i
know
this
to
be
true
for
i
wake
every
morning
thinking
solely
of
you
your
tender
touch
and
gentle
kiss
a
feeling
no
words
can
describe
something
i
yearn
for
when
you're
at
my
side
a
beauty
that
radiates
from
both
inside
and
out
a
heaven-sent
gift
no
question
about
a
passion
that
penetrates
as
deep
as
a
knife
i'm
happy
i
found
you
the
love
of
my
life

a
poem
for
my
secret
love
i
want
to
share
my
feelings
and
i
don't
know
how
to
start
but
every
single
word
i
say
is
coming
from
my
heart
the
first
time
that
i
met
you
all
you
said
was
"""hey"""
it
was
really
just
a
simple
word
but
it
took
my
breath
away
you
were
very
fun
to
talk
with
you
were
extremely
sweet
and
kind
i
was
in
love
with
every
thing
you
said
you
were
amazing
in
my
mind
you
fill
my
days
with
brightness
you
lift
me
up
when
i
feel
blue
you
make
me
feel
like
i'm
someone
special
so
i'd
do
anything
for
you
for
"you,"
i'd
walk
across
the
desert
so
"hot,"
without
a
breeze
for
"you,"
i'd
dive
into
the
ocean
and
be
swallowed
by
the
seas
i
barely
even
know
"you,"
so
this
may
be
a
surprise
there's
nothing
that
you
could
do
wrong
because
you're
flawless
in
my
eyes
i
always
wonder
where
you
are
and
i
wish
i
could
be
there
you're
probably
so
far
away
but
i
can
feel
you
everywhere.
you're
the
constant
beating
in
my
heart
you're
the
blood
rushing
through
my
veins
you're
the
light
glowing
from
a
moonbeam
you're
the
crystal
droplets
in
the
rain
you're
the
colors
in
the
sunset
you're
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
you're
the
twinkling
in
the
nighttime
stars
you're
the
very
air
i
breathe
i
care
for
you
each
hour
i
dream
of
you
all
week
you're
the
last
person
running
through
my
mind
before
i
drift
to
sleep
i'm
so
grateful
that
you're
in
my
life
maybe
someday
we'll
be
together
i
love
"you,"
and
only
you
i
always
will

could

you

"elizabeth,"

you
could
"sit,"

a
place
where
you
could

moment

you
could
