my
one
and
only
love
my
princess
"angel,"
I
love
you
and
miss
you
and
am
thinking
about
you
non-stop.
you
are
always
in
my
heart
and
on
my
mind.
there
is
nothing
I
wouldn't
do
to
see
you
smile
and
hear
you
laugh
that
laugh
that
even
the
angels
in
heaven
would
envy.
you
are
the
light
and
the
warmth
in
my
"darkness,"
and
the
wholeness
in
my
life.
without
you
"here,"
I
sail
in
darkness
losing
my
way.
but
fortunately
you
are
"there,"
my
guiding
star
in
the
night
sky.
shining
"bright,"
clear
and
"strong,"
showing
me
the
way
with
a
love
that
stretches
from
heaven
to
the
ends
of
creation.
and
the
only
problem
I
have
is
that
there
aren't
any
words
good
enough
for
me
to
tell
you
how
I
truly
feel
about
"you,"
no
words
except
that
I
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
"soul,"
always
and
forever.
you
are
my
one
and
only
princess
"angel,"
and
my
only
love.

you're
my
best
friend
and

lover
I
know
this
to
be
true
for
I
wake
every

thinking
solely
of
you
your
tender

and
gentle

a
feeling
no

describe
something
I
yearn
for
when
you're
at

a
beauty
that
radiates
from
both
inside
and
out

a
poem
for
my
secret
love
I
want
to
share
my
feelings
and
I
don't
know
how
to
start
but
every
single
word
I
say
is
coming
from
my
heart
the
first
time
that
I
met
you
all
you
said
was
"""hey"""
it
was
really
just
a
simple
word
but
it
took
my
breath
away
you
were
very
fun
to
talk
with
you
were
extremely
sweet
and
kind
I
was
in
love
with
every
thing
you
said
you
were
amazing
in
my
mind
you
fill
my
days
with
brightness
you
lift
me
up
when
I
feel
blue
you
make
me
feel
like
I'm
someone
special
so
I'd
do
anything
for
you
for
"you,"
I'd
walk
across
the
desert
so
"hot,"
without
a
breeze
for
"you,"
I'd
dive
into
the
ocean
and
be
swallowed
by
the
seas
I
barely
even
know
"you,"
so
this
may
be
a
surprise
there's
nothing
that
you
could
do
wrong
because
you're
flawless
in
my
eyes
I
always
wonder
where
you
are
and
I
wish
I
could
be
there
you're
probably
so
far
away
but
I
can
feel
you
everywhere.
you're
the
constant
beating
in
my
heart
you're
the
blood
rushing
through
my
veins
you're
the
light
glowing
from
a
moonbeam
you're
the
crystal
droplets
in
the
rain
you're
the
colors
in
the
sunset
you're
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
you're
the
twinkling
in
the
nighttime
stars
you're
the
very
air
I
breathe
I
care
for
you
each
hour
I
dream
of
you
all
week
you're
the
last
person
running
through
my
mind
before
I
drift
to
sleep
I'm
so
grateful
that
you're
in
my
life
maybe
someday
we'll
be
together
I
love
"you,"
and
only
you
I
always
will

life
seems

my
"love,"
I
need
you
to
"know,"
there
is
a
person
close
who
feels

a
person
close
who
holds
you

when
you
"cry,"
he
cries
"too,"
not
always
to
"see,"
but
always
and
with
the
full
depth
of
his
beating
heart.
when
you
do
not
cry
but
the
pain
shows
in
your
"eyes,"
he
will
know
and
share
this
"too,"
his
passion
hidden
under
a
stoic
"umbrella,"
a
shield
of
calm
prevents
emotion
displayed.
he
knows
of
your
journey
through
the
turbulence
of
"life,"
he
respects
and
admires
the
tireless
"fight,"
he
hates
a
world
that
could
cause
you
"pain,"
such
innocence
"undeserving,"
he
longs
for
your
return
to
the
"sun,"
a
summer's
mind
where
fears
dissipate
like
seeds
in
"wind,"
to
see
what
he
loves;
your
smile
to
"infinity,"
your
passion
for
life...
with
"vigour,"
with
"humour,"
with
cheer.
so
look
over
your
shoulder
and
he'll
be
"there,"
no
matter
the
"distance,"
the
"time,"
he'll
be
"there,"
watching
you
in
"sleep,"
aloof
in
morning
"haze,"
as
distance
grows
through
"day,"
the
care
for
you
remains.
he
is
your
"husband,"
your
"friend,"
your
"protector,"
your
"knight,"
he
is
me
my
"darling,"
he
is
me.

I

calm

I
look
back
on
the
dreams
I
left
behind;
buried
there
in
all
my
thoughts
it
is
you
I
always
find.
I
saw
you
then
as
I
see
you
now
through
love's
impassioned
"blindness,"
a
heart
so
fashioned
there
within
filled
with
love
and
kindness.
how
often
has
my
heart
declared
with
"anguish,"
for
my
words
are
"few,"
that
the
wind
shall
blow
a
little
"longer,"
to
keep
me
here
with
you.
sweeter
still
are
the
pains
of
love.
the
bonds
of
love
grow
"stronger,"
even
after
the
moonlight
has
gone
to
"sleep,"
I
shall
always
love
you
longer.
no
other
can
stir
my
heart
so
"deep,"
or
thrill
me
through
and
"through,"
and
in
my
dreams
there
will
never
be
no
other
love
but
you.
when
I
look
back
to
times
gone
by
there
is
one
sure
thing
I
know
it
is
you
my
"love,"
who
stole
my
heart
fifty
years
ago.

back
to

last

fell
away

I
saw
only
you
no
more
than
a

my
heart
somehow
knew
before
I
met
you
I'd
had
my
share
of
sorrow
so
I
was
instantly
guarded
and
full
of
bravado
you
were
never

and
you
saw
the

and
I
realised
I
can
only
be
the
best
I
can
be

shared
our
first
"laugh,"

not

"you,"

we
became

I
bared

broke
down

overwhelmed

has
continued

I
will
always
know

you

laugh
at

allay
any

holding

your

you
look
into
my
eyes
and
make
my
head

those
feelings
are
"back,"
but
stronger
than
ever
I

you're
the

I

we

christmas
time
is
here
again
I
wish
you
only
"knew,"
how
special
christmas
is
this
year
because
I
am
with
you.
this
year
I
don't
need
any
gifts
beneath
the
christmas
tree
the
only
thing
I'll
ever
want
is
you
to
be
with
me
I
put
you
on
my
christmas
list
and
mailed
it
like
a
kid
but
if
santa
didn't
bring
you
here
an
angel
surely
did
you're
my
favorite
gift
of
all
you've
filled
my
heart
with
cheer
I
hope
that
I
can
be
with
you
on
christmas
every
year

I
remember
that
day
when
all
with
the
world
was
right
everything
seemed
so
"very,"
very
bright
as
we
travelled
for
hours
along
that
winding
road
stopping
here
and
there
for
photos
to
upload
the
autumn
colours
as
beautiful
as
a
sunset
it
was
that
very
day
our
spirits
finally
met
in
a
place
finally
free
from
dark
subdued
light
"suddenly,"
we
were
finally
shining
so
bright
a
little
"overwhelming,"
I
had
said
it
could
be
you
needed
to
"breath,"
take
a
break
from
me
and
now
you
understand
those
dizzy
thoughts
the
ones
you
created
with
the
love
you
brought
the
love
I
hold
finally
to
be
shared
with
my
friend
for
whom
my
love
has
been
bared
this
love
not
to
be
"hidden,"
but
now
open
for
all
to
see
my
heart
freely
"given,"
please
take
all
of
me
your
heart
too
my
love
you
gave
for
me
to
hold
and
it's
"safe,"
deep
within
my
hearts
stronghold
forever
to
be
cherished
and
nourished
for
what
a
day
it
will
be
to
see
that
heart
flourish
keep
that
smile
upon
your
face
my
love
and
those
sparkling
eyes
keep
them
looking
above
for
those
shooting
stars
that
I'll
send
tonight
will
keep
our

pure
and
shining
throughout
the

it's
been
years
its
been
years
since
we
first
met
since
we
looked
into
each
other's
eyes
not
realizing
that
we
were
meant
to
be
together
it's
been
years
since
we
shared
our
first
laugh
our
first
smile
since
we
shared
our
first
kiss
I
remember
how
strong
your
arms
embraced
me
how
soft
you
held
me
how
warm
and
gentle
you
were
I
remember
how
passionate
that
first
kiss
was
now
my
heart
is
dancing
"happy,"
knowing
that
it's
been
years
it's
been
years
since
we
first
met
and
you're
still
here
kissing
me
just
the
same
you're
still
here
holding
me
just
the
same
what
I
felt
for
you
is
still
the
same
it's
been
years
and
that
feeling
will
never
change

key
to
my
heart
I
had
closed
the
door
upon
my
heart
and
wouldn't
let
anyone
"in,"
I
had
trusted
and
loved
only
to
be
hurt
"but,"
that
would
never
happen
again.
I
had
locked
the
door
and
tossed
the
key
as
"hard,"
and
as
far
as
I
"could,"
love
would
never
enter
there
"again,"
my
heart
was
closed
for
good.
then
you
came
into
my
life
and
made
me
change
my
"mind,"
just
when
I
thought
that
tiny
key
was
impossible
to
find.
that's
when
you
held
out
your
hand
and
proved
to
me
I
was
"wrong,"
inside
your
palm
was
the
key
to
my
heart...
you
had
it
all
along.

me

"butterflies,"

"smile,"
happy
"thoughts,"

to
the
next

meet.
what

"ahead,"
down
