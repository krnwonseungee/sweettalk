##Description:
Lorem ipsum generator for "romantic" speak. I used Mechanize in order to scrape words from around 100 different love poems through a custom rake task. 

##Challenges:



##Possible Enhancements (in the works):
* Have user be able to select # paragraphs
* Improve ipsum algorithm so generated ipsum is more grammatically correct 
..* mark each word with part of speech (n, vb, adj, etc.) using Engtagger and place restrictions on how words are arranged
* Create a gem and upload onto Rubygems.org
* Integrate Twilio API to be able to send lorem ipsums as text messages
